# üìå Inventory Management System for Database Course

## üìÑ Brief Description

The **Inventory Management System** is a full-stack web application built to streamline the tracking and management of stock, suppliers, and transactions for small to medium-sized businesses. It is developed as a final project for a university **Database Systems** course, showcasing solid relational database design, SQL programming (views, triggers, procedures), and integration with real-world tech tools.

This system solves the common issue of fragmented inventory records and manual errors by providing centralized, consistent, and real-time inventory control. It also extends traditional relational database capabilities with support for object storage (images, files) via **MinIO**.

### ProductOrderItem

**Purpose**: Manages the relationship between order items and products, including quantities and pricing.

| Field           | Type                  | Description                                      |

| **Primary Key** | `(product_id, order_item_id)` | Composite key ensuring unique product-order item pairs |

## Notes

- **Primary Keys (PK)**: Most tables use an auto-incrementing `INT` as the primary key. `product_order_items` uses a composite primary key (`product_id`, `order_item_id`).
- **Foreign Keys (FK)**: Enforce referential integrity (e.g., `warehouse_id` in `users` references `warehouses`).
- **Timestamps**: `created_time` and `updated_time` are included in all tables for auditing.
- **ENUMs**: Used for fields with fixed values (e.g., `role_name` in `users`, `status` in `orders`).
- **Image URLs**: The `image_url` fields in `products` and `users` reference avatar or product images, typically hosted externally (e.g., DiceBear for avatars).
- **One-to-One Category Relationship**: Each product is assigned to one category via `category_id` in the `products` table.
- **Inventory Tracking**: The `products` table tracks stock levels directly via the `quantity` field, associated with a specific warehouse.
- **Order Structure**: The `order_items` table links orders to products through `product_order_items`, allowing multiple products per order item with specified quantities and prices.

This schema supports a robust inventory management system with user authentication, product categorization, stock tracking, and order processing.
